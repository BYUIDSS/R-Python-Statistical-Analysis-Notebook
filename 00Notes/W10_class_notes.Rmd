# Logistic Regression
[Simple Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression.html)

- notice that if your binomials have a value greater than 0, you can have the logistical regression have the y value set to [variable] > 0 so that it'll accept anything above 0 as a success (i.e. '1').

This week we're collecting our own data for the Logistic Regression analysis.

Notice that for this we want the p-value to be GREATER than alpha. This is because the null hypothesis is backwards than normal: we're TRYING to accept that null is true instead of trying to reject the null.
